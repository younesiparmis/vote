# Voting Eligibility Checker

This is a simple C++ program that checks if a user is eligible to vote based on their age and citizenship.

## How it Works

1. Run the program.
2. Enter your age.
3. Indicate whether you are a citizen by typing 'y' for yes or 'n' for no.
4. The program will tell you if you meet the age requirement and if you can vote.
